# odin-sign-up-form

A project for creating a sign up-page for [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript). The sign-up feature is created using forms with validation checks and the page is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A live version can be viewed [on GitHub pages](https://studsministern.github.io/odin-sign-up-form/).

JavaScript is used to make sure "Password" and "Confirm password" are equal. All other input fields use pattern validation. Error messages with instructions are shown on incorrect inputs, as shown in the image above on the right. The image on the right also shows how the page supports mobile devices by using media queries to change the styling.
